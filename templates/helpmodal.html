            This application is a byproduct of the master thesis of Stephan Gabler. The idea is to predict responses of odor receptors to molecules which were not previously tested for this receptor. The models are based on support vector regression with different chemical descriptors. A detailed description of the whole procedure can hopefully soon be found in Molecular Informatics.

            The predictive power of all models was estimated by a cross-validation (CV) like bootstrap technique. This value can be used to assess how reliable the predictions of a model are.
